To get started on development, first create a virtual environment:

    rm -rf venv && virtualenv -p python3 venv

Then, use the virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

If you need to load the requirements then you can load the requirements file
after you've activated the virtual environment:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If the requirements file still needs to be built then use this command:

    pip install flask gunicorn eventlet flask-moment requests

If you make changes to the requirements, you can save the new requirements:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

You can run a development instance of your application like this:

    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=lib:$PYTHONPATH FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_CONFIG=configurations/development.cfg venv/bin/python3 venv/bin/gunicorn dart.portal.loader:app -b unix:/srv/run/sites/sockets/dart-portal.sock --worker-class=eventlet --log-config=lib/dart/portal/configurations/logging/development.conf

When you're done, you can deactivate it:

    deactivate
