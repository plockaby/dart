To get started on development, first create a virtual environment:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv

Then, use the virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

If you need to load the requirements then you can load the requirements file
after you've activated the virtual environment:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If the requirements file still needs to be built then use this command:

    pip install flask gunicorn eventlet cassandra-driver crontab kombu pytz flask-moment pyyaml

If you make changes to the requirements, you can save the new requirements:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

To start a development instance of your application, you can run this command:

    ./manage.py run -p 3000 --reload --debugger

If you need to test the gunicorn instance, you can start it like this:

    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=lib:$PYTHONPATH FLASK_CONFIG=configurations/development.cfg venv/bin/python3 venv/bin/gunicorn dart.web.loader:app -b 127.0.0.1:3000 --worker-class=eventlet --log-config=lib/dart/web/configurations/logging.conf

When you're done, you can deactivate it:

    deactivate

You can only deploy from a NON-virtualenv environment.
